## Lab Report 4

1. `<up><enter>` I ran these commands to go up 1 in the search history because the `ssh cs15lsp23id@ieng6.ucsd.edu` was 1 up in my history. I used this command to log into my `ieng6` account. It took me around 5 seconds to complete this step.
2. `<up><up><up><up><up><up><enter>` I ran these commands to go 6 up in my search history because that was where the `git clone git@github.com:mk7652/lab7.git` command was. This command cloned the fork of the repository I made. The timer is at around 10 seconds. 
3. `<ctrl + c><ctrl + v><enter>` I did this to copy `javac -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar *.java` off the Week 3 web page. This command compiles all of the files that end in `.java`. Then I did `<ctrl + c><ctrl + v><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><delete><ctrl + c><ctrl + v><enter>` to copy and paste `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ArrayTests` from the Week 3 webpage then I deleted `ArrayTests` and then I copied and pasted `ListExamplesTests.java` from the lab7 repository so the final command looked like `java -cp .:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore ListExamplesTests.java`. This command ran the tests in `ListExamplesTests.java` and showed that 1 test ran and that there was 1 faliure. The timer is now at 54 seconds. 
4. `<v><i><m>< ><shift + l><i><s><t><shift+ e><x><a><m><p><l><e><s><.><j><a><v><a><enter><x><i><2><esc><:wq>` This command allowed me to use vim to edit ListExamples.java by typing in `vim ListExamples.java`. Then, when I entered vim, my cursor was already on the `1` of `index1` so I typed `x` to delete it. Then, I went into insert mode by typing `i` and then I typed `2` and to change `index` to `index2` then `esc` to leave insert mode. then I typed `:wq` to save my changes and return to commit mode. The timer is now at 1:35.
