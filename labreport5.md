# Lab Report 5

## Student EdStem Post

Hello, I am curently experiencing errors in my code for `grader.sh`. For background, I am on a Mac and I am running commands in a terminal on VS Code. I am currently experiencing a bug when I try running the command `$ bash grade.sh https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3` as the command clones the repository correctly but for some reason it is giving me the errors as seen below in the screenshot of my code. This command is supposed to take in a students submission and grade it then give certian feedback based on their errors. It does this by cloning the given repository into a file called `student-submission` and this file's contents gets replaced after every time this code is run. when I ran this command the current working directory was `list-examples-grader?organization=mk7652&organization=mk7652` as seen in the screenshot. I didn't run any commands before this as I just opened up my code after not working on it for a while.   


I am not exactly sure what may be causing this error but if I had to guess the bug is probably some sort of syntax error as formatting `.sh` files can be really confusing to me because of all the little details.
