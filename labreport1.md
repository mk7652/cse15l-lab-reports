This tutorial will be about how to remote connect and typing in and testing out some useful commands. Despite the lab report asking to include how to install VS code, I already had it installed on my conputer from CSE 8B as we used it for our PAs and I do not remember how I installed it. Also, because I am a Mac user, I did not have to install git so my report skips past that part as well. Therefore, my lab report will begin at how to remote connect.

In order to remote connect, you must first log onto your account look up with your username and student PID. You will see a list of course specific accounts and you must change the password of your account for CSE 15L as you will be using this new password later. Then go to VSCode and open a new terminal and type in the command ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu but replace the zz with the letters in your id. Then Because I have already loged in before it will ask me to input my password. If your password is correct it will load something like what is in the following image. If it is incorrect, you will be prompted to enter you password again as displayed bt the seccond image.
