This tutorial will be about how to remote connect and typing in and testing out some useful commands. Despite the lab report asking to include how to install VS code, I already had it installed on my conputer from CSE 8B as we used it for our PAs and I do not remember how I installed it. Also, because I am a Mac user, I did not have to install git so my report skips past that part as well. Therefore, my lab report will begin at how to remote connect.

In order to remote connect, you must first log onto your account look up with your username and student PID. You will see a list of course specific accounts and you must change the password of your account for CSE 15L as you will be using this new password later. Then go to VSCode and open a new terminal and type in the command ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu but replace the zz with the letters in your id. Then because I have already loged in before it will ask me to input my password for my CSE 15L account (this is the password you had to change earlier). If your password is correct it will load something like what is in the following image. If it is incorrect, you will be prompted to enter you password again as displayed bt the second image.

After you have successfully input your password and your terminal looks like the first image, you may now start typing in some commands. Some commands which I typed in are ls, which tells you what is in a certian driectory and if nothing is typed after the command it is what is in the current directory, cd, which is change directory and if nothing is typed after the command it goes to the home directory, pwd, which shows the current working directory, and cat, which conactinates. An example of some of these commands in use is displayed in the image below.
